# react-projects

This repo contains set of relatively small react projects (most of them are more CSS oriented). 

Projects are organized as separate components.
See the *Projects* folder for the actual projects. 
In most of the cases just rendering one of the components (without giving props) from the Projects folder
should render something on screen. For more info about the project check comments inside that project source.

I hope this repo can be useful for people who want to learn more about react/CSS.
